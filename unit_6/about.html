	<h1>about me.</h1>
	<p>My name is Jackie. I'm an aspiring UX designer and web designer.  A complete career change has brought me to take General Assembly's HTML/CSS and Web Design class, continuing on to their User Exerience Design course.  From a young age, I've always been keen on good design and color, and appreciate the beauty in simplicity.  Put simply, I know and love what looks good.  <br>I've always been interested in creating beautiful things via crocheting, knitting, or crafting with cardstock paper, glitter, and pens.  Substitute the crochet needle and scissors for my MacBook, headphones, and a good eye for design and here we are.  <br>I love to excercise my creative muslces. Have a look at my portfolio.  Let's chat.</p>
